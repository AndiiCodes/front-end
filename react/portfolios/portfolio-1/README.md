# Portfolio v5 ![dev](https://github.com/nuIIpointerexception/www.seekvisualartist.com/actions/workflows/dev.yml/badge.svg) ![master](https://github.com/nuIIpointerexception/www.seekvisualartist.com/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg)

This is the fifth iteration of my portfolio website. It is built with Next.js, React and Tailwind CSS.

My goal was to try out a simplistic glass-morphism-like design and learn more about React and Next.js.

## Deployment üì¶

Now you'll only need to deploy the app to your favorite hosting provider.
Personally I'd recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

1. Build the app

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2. Start the production server

    bun run start
    ```
