    Jupiter (Latin: Iūpiter or Iuppiter,[14] from Proto-Italic *djous "day, sky"
    + *patēr "father", thus "sky father" Greek: Δίας or Ζεύς),[15] also known as
    Jove (gen. Iovis [ˈjɔwɪs]), is the god of the sky and thunder, and king of
    the gods in ancient Roman religion and mythology. Jupiter was the chief
    deity of Roman state religion throughout the Republican and Imperial eras,
    until Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire. In Roman
    mythology, he negotiates with Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to
    establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.

    Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
    System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of
    all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than
    one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest
    natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has
    been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief
    deity of ancient Roman religion.

    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, followed by helium, which
    constitutes a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing
    contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet
    receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per
    10 hours, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but
    noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a
    series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their
    interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a
    giant storm which has been observed since at least 1831.
